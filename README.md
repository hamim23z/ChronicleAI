# ChronicleAI Project


### Project Recap

This is a team project. The team consists of me, Alexis Juarez Gomez, Hamim Choudhury, and Kenneth Romero Linares. The purpose
of this project was to create an AI chatbot. Me and my team members designed this specifically for computer science students. There
is still some fine tuning that needs to be done, but it does work fairly well. Users will be able to ask any sort of question to the 
AI named Chad.
